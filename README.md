# Great Datasets: A Love Story

Materials for Alex Cookson's [March 25, 2021 presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2aRKZczqKY) to the [Toronto Data Workshop](https://rohanalexander.com/toronto_data_workshop.html)

If you'd like to download the presentation slides, there is a [PPT version](https://github.com/tacookson/toronto-data-workshop-march-2021/raw/main/Great%20Datasets%20-%20A%20Love%20Story%20(to%20download).pptx) and a [PDF version](https://github.com/tacookson/toronto-data-workshop-march-2021/raw/main/Great%20Datasets%20-%20A%20Love%20Story%20(to%20download).pdf). I recommend the PPT version, if possible. The GIFs and one animated graph don't work on the PDF -- but you'll still get the idea.

If you'd like to download any of the datasets mentioned in the presentation, they are all available on my [`data`](https://github.com/tacookson/data) repository.

Thank you for having me!
